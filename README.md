# flappy_birds_Mobile_App

## Game Description
The Flappy Bird game is a simple yet highly engaging mobile game inspired by the original Flappy Bird. It involves controlling a bird to navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The bird continuously falls due to gravity, and the player must tap the screen to make it jump upward. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns the player a point. The game is over if the bird collides with a pipe or goes off-screen.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide an enjoyable and challenging game that showcases the implementation of core game development principles using Flutter. It also serves as a learning tool for exploring:
1.Real-time physics simulation (gravity, velocity).
2. Collision detection and dynamic object movement.
3. UI and UX design for interactive mobile applications.

## Problem It Solves
This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight and responsive mobile game, solving problems often encountered in real-time applications:
1. Efficiently managing animations and object rendering in a mobile environment.
2. Implementing accurate and responsive user interactions.
3. Maintaining performance even with multiple dynamic elements on the screen.

## Gameplay Features
1. Engaging Mechanics: The bird's jump and gravity effects create a fun and challenging gameplay loop.
2. Dynamic Content: Randomized pipe positions ensure that no two games are the same, keeping the experience fresh.
3. Progress Tracking: A scoring system allows players to track their achievements and aim for higher scores.
4. Game Over State: Clear feedback on the gameâ€™s conclusion, with options to restart, enhances the overall user experience.

## Educational Purpose
The project serves as an excellent example for developers interested in:
1. Creating interactive mobile applications.
2. Implementing game logic using Flutter.
3. Understanding real-time updates and physics in a 2D environment.
4. This project not only entertains but also provides a solid foundation for further exploration into mobile game development.

## Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or another Flutter-supported IDE.
3. Run flutter pub get to fetch dependencies.
4. Use flutter run to launch the application.

## Usage Instructions:
1. Tap the play button to start the game.
2. Avoid pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird jump.
3. Restart the game after a Game Over by pressing the restart button.

## Dependencies:
1. Flutter SDK
2. Dart SDK
3. Assets folder containing images.
